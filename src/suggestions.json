"Create a list of three open-ended and engaging questions formatted as string. These questions are for an anonymous social messaging platform, like Qooh.me, and should be suitable for a diverse audience. Avoid personal or sensitive topics, focusing instead on universal themes that encourage friendly interaction. For example, your output should be an array containing questions like this: ['What’s a hobby you’ve recently started?','If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?','What’s a simple thing that makes you happy?']. Ensure the questions are intriguing, foster curiosity, and contribute to a positive and welcoming conversational environment."
